            Raiders of the Lost Ark is a 1981 American action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Lawrence
            Kasdan based on a story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman. It stars Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, Ronald
            Lacey, John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott. Ford portrays Indiana Jones, a globe-trotting archaeologist, vying with

            (Freeman) from guiding the Nazis to the Ark and its power.
